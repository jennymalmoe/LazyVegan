## 1. UX
### Project Goals
The purpose of this project is to *"...build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain"* using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB and possible additional libraries and external APIs.

### Business Goals
Create a web application that allows users to:
    
* Add their own recipes to the website (CREATE)
* Find free recipes online (READ)
* Edit their recipes (UPDATE)

In addition to the goals above; also to promote a brand of cooking tools by linking them to the recipes. 

Eventually the recipe database will increase in both recipes and users/visitors. The site offer users to interact by adding their own recipes that makes the user feel like being a part of "the community". An important business goal is to be able to contact users using their provided contact information, to offer them additional sales/marketing/offers.

### Design Choices

* Color scheme

    The page consists of a white base with black and Island Green as secondary colors. Text and elements such as call to actions buttons and icons are black to make the text/information stand out and be as clear as possible. When hover buttons, they turn to the Island Green color to tie different elements of the sites together. The chosen colour scheme was specifically selected in order to define the vibe of the page. 

    Green is usually associated with healthy, organic and vegetarian food. The Island Green and white color combination is clean, crisp, and are associated with nature and environmental awareness. The Island Green color has a warm vibe while the supporting soft white lend a modern look. 
    
    Since green is found commonly in nature, it makes it an excellent choice for recipes sites with healthy and plant based foods. Many Health food stores, Salad bars and Vegan restaurants chooses these kind of colors.

* Typography

    Copse font is the main font used throughout the site with Pacifico and Staatliches as headers fonts. Copse is a low-contrast slab serif that is a little soft around the edges, but with clear and sturdy posture (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Copse?category=Serif&query=copse#glyphs) and feels modern and clean. It's subtle and it doesn´t take any attention away from the content. Pacifico is a fun brush script handwriting font that gives the site an easy going vibe. Staatliches is a clean but charmig and unconventional font that also gives the site a relaxed vibe. The combination of the three fonts represents both the healty, vegan side aswell as the relaxed fast food approach. 

* Imagery
    Images and the choices of the images is an important component of this site. Websites with eye catching, beautiful images that appeal to the public at first glance, tends to get much more views and interests than text dominated sites. 

* Icons
    Icons used in footer to set the tone for the sites design approach.(ÄNDRA)
