# Testing

<br>

### Automated Testing

<br>

To make make it easier to validate html code, since using jinja templating language throughout all pages, which results in errors in online validators. I copied the code from "View page source" and pasted it in "The W3C Markup Validation". Still one error keept showing at every page (due to jinja templating language) when run in validator. The section showed in page source because of the div and h4 (I guess). This also happend (due to jinja templating) when validated profile page (see screenshots below). 

As seen there where no other errors.

<br>

Returning error:

Profile Page errors due to jinja template language as well:

# Bugs Discovered

**Solved Bugs**

The developer ran into several issues during the development of the site. These are the most distinguishing ones, along with the solution:

* Image URL didn't show when edited a recipe. It turned out that there needed to be placeholder and value in the input tag for the image. When *value="{{ recipe.recipe_img }}"* and *placeholder="{{ recipe.recipe_img }}"* was added, image URL showed as expected as pre-filled content in edit form. 
* Intro text and image in Home page had col-12 added to their div's. They were removed and replaced by col s12 as use Materialize design and not Bootstrap.
* Register button in Home page wasn't centered as expected in medium and small screensizes. This was solved adding a new main class in stylesheet:" .search-section". Then added display:flex and flex-direction:row to that class, as well as added display:flex and flex-direction: row in the media query for small devices.
